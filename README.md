# typing-storm-project
TypeStorm is a typing-behavior analyzer that tracks speed, accuracy, key usage, and mistakes in real time. It generates a keyboard heatmap and a “Rage Score” based on backspaces and chaotic typing. Each session is saved so users can see their habits and improvement over time.
